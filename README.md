# Interpretable Scorecard Model for Early Diabetes Classification

This project aims to build predictive models to identify individuals at risk of early-stage diabetes based on a variety of health-related features. We leverage multiple machine learning techniques, including simpler models like Logistic Regression and more complex models like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting. Additionally, we focus on generating an interpretable risk scorecard using the FasterRisk algorithm, which can be used by healthcare professionals to make informed decisions.
